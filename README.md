<p>This project has been implemented in the context of my diploma thesis, while studying at Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID) of the University of Patras. It is about an Android application that captures a low-resolution picture and sends it to an FPGA-based system, via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. Then, the embedded system processes the image by applying a Gaussian blurring filter and then sends the new picture back to the Android device, so that the user can compare the two images. The main subject of the project concerns the BLE communication between the FPGA and the smartphone.</p>
